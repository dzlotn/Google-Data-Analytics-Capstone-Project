# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project - Attrition Analytics
This is my code for the Google Advanced Data Analytics Course Capstone Project.

**The Project:**

This project analyzes employee data to uncover the key factors influencing employee turnover. By examining variables like tenure, work evaluation, number of projects, and satisfaction levels, it predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company. The analysis employs binomial logistic regression and random forest models, achieving high accuracy and actionable insights to guide HR strategies.


**Technologies Used:**

Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, Sci-Py, Pickle, Tableau
